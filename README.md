### A small news app :newspaper:

#### :books: In this app, I used libraries such as: 

- react router dom
- redux
- redux thunk
- axios
- sass

#### A little about the app :nerd_face:

Implemented transition between pages without reloading. When you first load the application, the main page opens, which displays part of the news, by clicking on any of them the detailed page of the news is available.   When you go to the news page, you can see all the news, and the same page of detailed news is available when you click on each. Contacts page is nothing more than a dummy page (don't judge for such bad design)
